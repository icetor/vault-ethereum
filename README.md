# Vault Ethereum  
 
Vault Ethereum is an extension to the standard Vault deployment that integrates Ethereum functionalities directly into your secure secret management infrastructure. This repository provides both the core Vault instance and the Ethereum plugin, enabling you to interact with Ethereum networks in a secure, auditable, and scalable manner.  
 
## Overview  
 
Vault Ethereum is designed to:  
- **Securely Manage Secrets:** Leverage Vaultâ€™s robust secret management capabilities to protect your Ethereum keys and credentials.  
- **Integrate with Ethereum:** Seamlessly interact with Ethereum networks, smart contracts, and decentralized applications via a dedicated plugin.  
- **Simplify Operations:** Provide straightforward scripts and configuration files to build, deploy, and manage both Vault and its Ethereum functionalities.  
 
## Features  
 
- **Vault Integration:**  
  - Utilizes HashiCorp Vault for secure secret storage and dynamic credential generation.  
  - Supports TLS and mTLS for secure communication.  
 
- **Ethereum Plugin:**  
  - Build and deploy an Ethereum plugin for direct blockchain interaction.  
  - Manage Ethereum keys, addresses, and transaction signing within Vault.  
 
- **Containerized Deployment:**  
  - Dockerized setup for both Vault and the Ethereum plugin ensures consistent environments.  
  - Pre-configured Dockerfiles and scripts simplify the build and deployment process. 
 
## Prerequisites  
 
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for containerized deployment.  
- [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for secret management.  
- Basic knowledge of Ethereum and smart contract development (if using the Ethereum plugin).  
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces and shell scripting.
